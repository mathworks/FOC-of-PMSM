# FOC-of-PMSM
Field-Oriented Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using NXP™ S32K144 and S32K344 Development Kits

This example implements a motor control system using the NXP™ motor control kits. These kits, which use the NXP™ microcontroller, can run motor control applications designed for either a three-phase brushless DC (BLDC) or three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).
